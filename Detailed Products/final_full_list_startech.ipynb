Additionally, the coolant has restricted transmissibility to UV-Type C, which prevents it from degrading and changing color. Designed especially for the most discriminating customers who need improved functionality and supply tubing. High resistance to leaching was one of the key aims while developing this tube. EK-Loop Soft Tube uses a plasticizer that is free of phthalates. It is resistant to degradation and discoloration from Beta, UV, and Gamma rays. All components used in manufacture are US FDA sanctioned for food applications and meet USP Class VI for use in the medical industry. Exposure to sunlight through the tube wall is one of the primary causes of colored coolant deterioration. EK-Loop Soft Tube efficiently addresses this issue by using unique materials that make it extremely UV-Type C resistant. One of the most important considerations while manufacturing this tube was the high resistance to leaching. The plasticizer used by EK-Loop Soft Tube is non-phthalate.

Standard industry fans may have up to a 10% difference between fan rotation cycles (RPM). The Fan IC Control on SAPPHIRE graphics cards reduces differential at approximately 3%. The SAPPHIRE graphics cards are designed with robust VRM cooling and have a high thermal conductivity pad on the back plate to take away the heat efficiently and effectively. A robust memory cooling solution has been integrated into each SAPPHIRE graphics card to cool down memory with a specially designed independent cooling module. SAPPHIRE's acclaimed Dual-X Cooling is powered by two massive yet silent fans and a state-of-the-art radiator design which results in greater airflow and superior heatsink coverage at lower noise compared to standard cooling designs. The all-aluminum backplate provides additional rigidity that guarantees nothing bends and dust stays out. It also helps cool the user's card by increasing heat dissipation. Dual Ball bearing fans have an approximately 85% longer lifespan than sleeve bearings in our tests. To protect the user's card, the SAPPHIRE cards have fuse protection built into the circuit of the external PCI-E power connector to keep the components safe.
